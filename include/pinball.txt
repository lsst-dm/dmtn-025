Appendix F: Pinball
===================

Overview
--------

`Pinball`_ is a workflow management platform developed at `Pinterest`_, written
in Python, and distributed under `Apache License, v2.0`_.  From project’s
documentation:

    [Pinball] is built based on layered approach. The base layer provides a
    generic master-worker model. Master maintains the system state represented
    by a collection of abstract tokens. Tokens are claimed and modified by
    workers implementing application specific logic. The application layer
    introduces tokens specific to workflows, workers implementing the job
    execution logic, a parser converting workflow specification to a collection
    of tokens, a scheduler allowing us to prepare workflow execution ahead of
    time, and a UI for manual control and monitoring.

Features
--------

Sadly, available online resources does not provide any metrics regarding
Pinball’s flexibility, performance metrics, interoperability, reliability and
scalability. Supposedly, there is a web-based UI to monitor workflow execution,
but there is no documentation regarding it.

Support
-------

Pinball is being developed by 3 programmers associated with Pinterest.

There is a Google `group`__ mentioned in official documentation for sending
question and comments but it seems to be abandoned by developers. It is mostly
filled with spam and few posts with actual questions about pinball were not
addressed at all.

We did not find any third parties using Pinball internally as its workflow
management systems. The project does not seem to be in active development
anymore; its GitHub repo shows only few commits during last year.

Though Pinterest was valued at $11 billion at June, 2015 it is hard to tell how
well Pinball project is funded and what are company’s long-term plans regarding
it.


User experience
---------------

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides project’s ``README`` file, Pinball’s documentation is practically
non-existent.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pinball requires:

-  `Graphviz`_: a graph visualization software,
-  ``libmysqlclient``: MySQL client libraries.

Pinball uses MySQL database as persistent storage so an access to a running
MySQL instance is also required.

Installation is very easy; `Pinball package`_ is available via `PyPI`_ and can
be installed by ``pip``.


Hands-on experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Taking into account overall impression (lack of decent documentation and
support), we did not even try to setup an example workflow with Pinball.

Summary
-------

Pinballs looks like a rather immature project with uncertain future.
Practically, it has no documentation, does not seem to be actively developed,
and support from developers looks rather poor.  `Others
<http://bytepawn.com/pinball.html#pinball>`__ seems to come to similar
conclusions though to be fair at least installation issue was fixed (see the
link above). As a result, it is not a viable candidate for use with LSST Batch
Operation Services.
