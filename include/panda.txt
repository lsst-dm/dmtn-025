Appendix D: PanDa
=================

Overview
--------

`PanDA`_ is a highly scalable and flexible data-driven workload management
system designed to meet the demanding computing requirements of the ATLAS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. PanDA has served ATLAS
since 2008 and was released under `Apache License, v2.0`_. While it was
originally designed specifically for ATLAS, the core design of PanDA is not
experiment specific.

Features
--------

Flexibility
^^^^^^^^^^^

It might be emphasized that PanDA is foremost a *workload* management system
concerned with the large scale management of jobs to a possibly diverse
collection of computing sites. PanDA does support workflow with the combination
of `JEDI`_ and `DEFT`_, though we might note that these are relatively recent
additions. They utilize `GraphML`_ format to represent a DAG corresponding to a
given workflow.

Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

PanDA comes with a web based monitoring and browsing system that provides an
interface to PanDA for users and operators.

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

PanDa proved itself as a scalable and reliable system capable of handling very
large workflow. In 2014, PanDA processed about a million jobs per day, with
about 150,000 jobs running at any given time.

Interoperability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BigPanDA project was established in 2012 as an extension of the PanDA
project. BigPanDA strives to generalize PanDA for use by other experiments, and
to extend its scope to computing clouds and HPC platforms.

Reliability
^^^^^^^^^^^

Scalability
^^^^^^^^^^^

PanDA is capable of handling very large workflows.


Support
-------

The PanDA analysis user community numbers over 1400.

User experience
---------------

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PanDA comes with an exhaustive documentation describing architecture of all its
numerous components. However, it does not provide any tutorial or a user guide.
Thus, taking into account projectâ€™s scale, there is a significant overhead for
newcomers to overcome just to get started with it.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, we did not installed PanDA locally. Though taking into
account that it is a complex, multicomponent systems its installation
process may *not* be trivial.

Hands-on experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See above.

Summary
-------

PanDA has its primary power as a workload management system. The support for
workflow appears solid enough but is provided by more recent additions within
noncore components. It has been highly successful for the ATLAS experiment
computing on worldwide Grids that include European Grids, the Open Science
Grid, etc.  However, it is a sizable system with numerous components and it
will require significant startup costs and investment by LSST DM.  Nevertheless
we recommend PanDA for further consideration regarding LSST Batch Operation
Services.
